# Project Constitution — ODE Lab

## Purpose

ODE Lab exists to develop:

1. Strong software engineering discipline
2. Deep understanding of numerical ODE methods
3. A professional-quality portfolio system

All decisions must support these goals.

## Scope

### In Scope

* Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)
* Initial Value Problems (IVP)
* Boundary Value Problems (BVP)
* Numerical solver implementation
* Solver diagnostics and comparison
* Interactive visualization
* Extensible architecture

### Out of Scope

* PDE solvers
* Machine learning integration
* GPU acceleration
* Large-scale scientific computing frameworks
* Unbounded feature expansion

The system must remain focused and elegant.

---

## Architectural Principles

### Core / Interface Separation

Numerical core must remain independent from UI or visualization layers.

### Extensibility

New solvers and simulations must be addable with minimal core modification.

### Determinism

Solver behavior must be reproducible and transparent.

### Clarity

Readable, understandable implementations are preferred over cleverness.

---

## Quality Bar

The project follows professional-grade standards:

* Clean readable code
* Consistent structure
* Strong testing discipline
* Clear documentation
* Stable main branch

All core numerical behavior must be demonstrably correct.

---

## Learning Policy

External references may be used freely.
However:

* Implementations must be understood
* Blind copying is forbidden
* All core logic must be explainable

AI tools may assist understanding,
but final code must be fully owned and comprehended.

---

## Decision Authority

When uncertain:

1. Preserve clarity and simplicity
2. Protect architecture
3. Avoid unnecessary expansion
4. Favor deep understanding over speed
