# Vision — ODE Lab

## Role

This document defines the long-term direction of ODE Lab.

It describes what the system becomes when mature.
It does not define implementation rules or growth phases.

## Vision Statement

ODE Lab is an interactive computational laboratory for exploring ordinary differential equations through implementation, experimentation, and visualization.

It is designed as a clean, extensible system where:

- Numerical solvers can be implemented and compared
- Dynamic systems can be explored interactively
- Results can be visualized and analyzed
- New systems can be added without altering core
- The system remains understandable and structured

ODE Lab is not intended to replicate large scientific libraries.
It is intended to be an elegant and deeply understood numerical instrument.

## Mature Capabilities

In its mature form, the system will allow:

- Swapping and comparing solvers easily
- Interactive parameter experimentation
- Extending visualization tools
- Adding new simulations modularly
- Supporting structured custom system definitions

The finished system should feel like a carefully engineered scientific instrument:
precise, extensible, and clear in design.
