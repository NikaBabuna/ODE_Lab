# Vision — ODE Lab

ODE Lab is an interactive computational laboratory for exploring ordinary differential equations through implementation, experimentation, and visualization.

It is designed as a clean, extensible system where numerical solvers and dynamic systems can be implemented, tested, compared, and visualized within a unified environment.

The system combines:

* A modular ODE solver library
* A curated collection of dynamic simulations
* Interactive parameter exploration
* Visualization and diagnostic tools
* A structured environment for defining new systems

ODE Lab is not intended to replicate large scientific libraries.
It is intended to be an elegant and deeply understood numerical laboratory.

In its mature form, the system should allow:

* Swapping and comparing solvers easily
* Exploring system behavior interactively
* Adding new simulations without altering core
* Extending visualization capabilities
* Defining custom systems within the environment

The finished project should feel like a carefully engineered scientific instrument:
precise, extensible, and clear in design.
