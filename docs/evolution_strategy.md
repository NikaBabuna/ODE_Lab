# Evolution Strategy — ODE Lab

## Growth Philosophy

Development follows a hybrid model:

Phase I — Careful foundational construction
Phase II — Stabilization and refinement
Phase III — Controlled expansion

The system must begin minimal, clean, and usable before expanding.

---

## Phase I: Foundational System

Focus:

* Core solver engine
* Unified interfaces
* Plugin architecture
* Small curated simulations
* Clean interactive interface
* Strong testing and documentation

No uncontrolled feature expansion permitted.

This phase ends when the system is stable, extensible, and usable.

---

## Phase II: Stabilization

Focus:

* Refactoring for clarity
* Strengthening tests
* Improving documentation
* Confirming extensibility

No major expansion until foundation is solid.

---

## Phase III: Expansion

Gradual addition of:

* Additional solvers
* Advanced visualization
* Custom simulation definition tools
* Diagnostic and comparison features

All expansion must respect architecture and clarity.

---

## Feature Introduction Rules

New features only added when:

* Aligned with vision
* Architecturally consistent
* Intentionally planned

Spontaneous additions are not allowed.

All ideas go to a recorded idea list for later review.

---

## Refactoring Policy

Imperfections are recorded and addressed deliberately.
Immediate refactoring only when blocking or damaging.

---

## Versioning

Project progresses through clear, stable versions.
Each version represents a coherent and usable state.

---

## Guiding Principle

Build minimal.
Stabilize fully.
Expand intentionally.

The system must grow like a well-engineered instrument.
