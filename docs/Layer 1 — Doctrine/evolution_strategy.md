# Evolution Strategy — ODE Lab

## Role

This document defines how ODE Lab grows over time.

It governs phases of development, expansion control, and structural stability.

Foundation definition is described in Core Specification.
Long-term direction is described in Vision.

---

## Growth Model

Development follows three phases:

Phase I — Foundation  
Phase II — Stabilization  
Phase III — Controlled Expansion  

---

## Phase I — Foundation

Goal:
Build a minimal, usable, architecturally sound core.

Focus:
- Solver engine
- Unified interfaces
- Extensibility foundation
- Minimal interactive lab
- Strong testing

Completion criteria are defined in Core Specification.

---

## Phase II — Stabilization

Goal:
Strengthen and clean the foundation before expansion.

Focus:
- Refactoring for clarity
- Strengthening tests
- Improving documentation
- Verifying extensibility

No major new features introduced in this phase.

---

## Phase III — Controlled Expansion

Goal:
Grow system toward Vision without compromising architecture.

Expansion may include:
- Additional solvers
- Advanced visualization
- Custom system definition tools
- Diagnostics and comparison features

All expansion must:
- Respect architecture
- Align with Vision
- Follow Constitution

---

## Feature Introduction Rules

New features must be:
- Intentionally planned
- Architecturally consistent
- Aligned with Vision

Spontaneous additions are not permitted.

---

## Refactoring Policy

Imperfections are recorded and addressed deliberately.
Immediate refactoring only when blocking or structurally damaging.

---

## Guiding Principle

Build minimal.
Stabilize fully.
Expand intentionally.
