# Phase I Weekly Execution Blueprint

## Purpose

This document defines the weekly planning and execution rhythm during Phase I (Foundation).

It exists only during core construction.
It ensures structured progress, visible momentum, and controlled intensity.

This document applies only to Phase I.

---

# Weekly Structure Overview

Each week follows a strict cycle:

1. Weekly Planning (Start of Week)
2. Daily Execution (During Week)
3. Weekly Closure (End of Week)

Each week must have:
- One dominant objective
- A defined checklist of deliverables
- A clean closure before proceeding

---

# 1. Weekly Planning Session

Duration: 30–60 minutes  
Occurs at the start of each week.

## Step 1 — Review Position

- Open Core Roadmap
- Review Core Progress Tracker
- Identify current roadmap milestone

Do not rethink architecture.
Do not change roadmap scope.
Align only.

---

## Step 2 — Define Weekly Objective

Define one dominant objective for the week.

Example:
- “RK45 fully implemented and verified”
- “Implicit solver with working Newton iteration”
- “Event detection system operational”

This objective must align directly with roadmap sequence.

Write it explicitly at top of weekly notes.

---

## Step 3 — Break Into Weekly Deliverables

Create a checklist of concrete deliverables that support the weekly objective.

Deliverables must be:
- Specific
- Measurable
- Finishable within the week

Example:

- [ ] Define adaptive step control interface
- [ ] Implement error estimation
- [ ] Implement step rejection
- [ ] Test on analytic ODE
- [ ] Verify convergence behavior

This becomes the operational checklist for the week.

---

# 2. Daily Execution Model

Each day:

1. Select one or two checklist items.
2. Execute using Workflow Bible discipline.
3. Update progress.
4. Stop at clean state.

No new features.
No scope expansion.
No architectural redesign.

If blocked:
- Solve within scope
- Or split into smaller task
- Do not redefine weekly objective impulsively

---

# 3. Mid-Week Adjustment Rule

Adjustments are allowed only if:

- A task was underestimated
- A technical dependency was discovered
- A subtask needs splitting

Weekly objective may only change if fundamentally impossible to complete.

Intensity is encouraged.
Scope drift is not.

---

# 4. Weekly Closure Ritual

Duration: 20–30 minutes  
Occurs at end of week.

## Step 1 — Objective Review

Was the dominant objective achieved?

- Yes → mark milestone progress
- No → assess honestly and decide whether:
  - Extend one more short cycle
  - Or formally move incomplete items to next week

No silent carryover.

---

## Step 2 — Codebase State Check

Verify:

- System runs
- No broken features
- No half-implemented logic
- Repository clean
- Tests passing

Core stability always preserved.

---

## Step 3 — Record Learning

Write 3–5 bullet points:

- What worked
- What was difficult
- What needs attention next week

Short. No essays.

---

# Weekly Intensity Rule

Phase I is high intensity.

However:

- Work must remain deliberate.
- No chaotic coding.
- No uncontrolled 12-hour debugging spirals.
- Sleep and clarity are part of discipline.

---

# Weekly Success Criteria

A week is successful if:

- Dominant objective achieved or responsibly evaluated
- Codebase remains clean
- Roadmap progress visible
- No structural instability introduced

---

# Phase I Mindset

Each week should feel like a focused engineering sprint.

You are constructing a nucleus.

Progress must be visible.
Scope must remain controlled.
Architecture must remain protected.
