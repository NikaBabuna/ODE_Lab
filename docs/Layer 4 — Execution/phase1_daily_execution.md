# Phase I Daily Execution Blueprint

## Purpose

This document defines the daily work rhythm during Phase I (Foundation).

It converts weekly objectives into focused daily progress.

It ensures:
- High-intensity execution
- Controlled scope
- Clean repository state
- Sustainable focus

This document applies only during Phase I.

# Daily Structure Overview

Each workday follows a fixed loop:

1. Daily Alignment (5–10 minutes)
2. Focused Work Block(s)
3. Clean-State Closure (10–15 minutes)

No deviation from this structure without reason.

---

# 1. Daily Alignment

Duration: 5–10 minutes  
Occurs before coding begins.

## Step 1 — Re-anchor

- Open Weekly Objective.
- Review Weekly Checklist.
- Identify current position.

Do not redesign.
Do not rethink architecture.
Align only.

---

## Step 2 — Select Today’s Target

Select 1–2 concrete checklist items.

Rules:
- Must directly support weekly objective.
- Must be realistically finishable today.
- Must not expand scope.

Write them down clearly before coding.

Example:

Today’s Target:
- Implement adaptive error estimate
- Add convergence test script

Once defined, do not add new tasks mid-session.

---

# 2. Focused Work Blocks

Work in 60–90 minute focused blocks.

During each block:

- Work only on selected task.
- No feature switching.
- No unrelated refactoring.
- No roadmap modifications.
- No browsing expansion ideas.

If blocked:
- Debug systematically.
- Break task into smaller unit.
- Avoid impulsive redesign.

Architecture changes are forbidden during daily execution unless absolutely necessary.

---

# 3. Scope Protection Rule

If a new idea appears:

- Write it in Idea Parking Lot.
- Return immediately to current task.

No idea may interrupt Phase I focus.

---

# 4. Clean-State Closure

Duration: 10–15 minutes  
Occurs before ending the session.

Verify:

- Code builds and runs.
- No half-implemented logic left broken.
- No commented-out temporary hacks.
- Tests pass (if applicable).
- Repository clean.

If something is incomplete:
- Leave a clear TODO comment.
- Document next small step.
- Do not leave system unstable.

---

# 5. Daily Success Criteria

A day is successful if:

- At least one meaningful checklist item completed
- Weekly objective advanced
- Repository remains stable
- No scope drift occurred

Intensity is measured by progress, not hours.

---

# 6. Stop Rule

Stop working when:

- Target tasks are complete
- Focus drops significantly
- You begin making careless mistakes

Do not push into chaotic late-night debugging spirals.

Clarity tomorrow is more valuable than extra exhausted output today.

---

# Phase I Mindset

Each day contributes to core construction.

Progress must be:
- Directed
- Controlled
- Clean

Small disciplined steps build the nucleus.
